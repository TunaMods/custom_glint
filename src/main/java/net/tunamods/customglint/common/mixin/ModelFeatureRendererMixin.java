/**
 * In-phase entity-body glow-outline capture, the vanilla-parity path (option A).
 *
 * <p>Vanilla's own glowing-entity outline tees a second {@code renderToBuffer} into a shared
 * {@code OutlineBufferSource} right after the body draws, while the model is still posed and
 * {@code setupAnim}'d (see {@code ModelFeatureRenderer.renderModel}, the {@code submit.outlineColor()}
 * block). That is why vanilla glow is nearly free for hundreds of entities: no second {@code setupAnim},
 * no per-entity {@code PoseStack}, no deferred re-walk, just one extra batched vertex emit.
 *
 * <p>We go one better than vanilla: rather than a SECOND {@code renderToBuffer} per glowing entity
 * (vanilla's cost, and what an earlier version of this mixin did), we redirect the body's single
 * {@code renderToBuffer} to fan its vertices into BOTH the normal buffer and our glow-mask buffer via a
 * {@link com.mojang.blaze3d.vertex.VertexMultiConsumer}. The silhouette is captured during the one model
 * walk the entity already does, a few extra vertex writes, no second traversal, no second setupAnim.
 * This is what makes glow scale like vanilla (the bottleneck was the per-entity second model walk).
 * {@code drainBodyOutlines} flushes the mask buffer and runs the single occluded composite.
 *
 * <p>Gated on {@code submit.model() == go.model()} so only the BODY model fans, overlay layers share
 * the render state but submit their own models/textures and must not be traced with the body texture.
