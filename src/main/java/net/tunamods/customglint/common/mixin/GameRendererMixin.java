/**
 * Captures the first-person hand projection matrix so the glow drain can scissor the held-item composite.
 *
 * <p>The first-person hand renders with its own projection ({@code GameRenderer.hudProjection}, set up
 * from {@code cameraState.hudFov} immediately before {@code renderItemInHand}). That projection is uploaded
 * to a GPU buffer, {@code RenderSystem.setProjectionMatrix} takes a {@code GpuBufferSlice}, not a
 * {@code Matrix4f}, so it can't be read back at the drain. We grab the {@code Matrix4f} here at
 * {@code renderItemInHand} HEAD (after {@code hudProjection} is configured) and hand it to
 * {@link EntityGlintRender} for the held-item composite scissor.
 *
 * <p><b>Held-item glow drain under an active Iris pack.</b> Off the shader path the first-person held
 * item's outline is drained inside {@code renderHandsWithItems} RETURN ({@code ItemInHandRendererMixin}),
 * while the hand pose's modelview is still on the stack. Under a pack Iris cancels vanilla's
 * {@code renderHandsWithItems} ({@code MixinGameRenderer.iris$disableVanillaHandRendering}) and renders the
 * hand itself, in-pipeline, via {@code HandRenderer.renderSolid}, baking the hand perspective + bob into
 * the uploaded projection and drawing with an identity modelview. So the held-item drain moves HERE, to
 * {@code renderItemInHand} RETURN (past Iris's pass, no gbuffer hijack), and reconstructs that state from
 * the still-bound {@code hudProjection} + a rebuilt bob modelview. See the TRIED history on the RETURN
 * method for the two earlier dead ends. Gated on {@link CustomGlintRenderer#isShaderPackActive()} so it
 * doesn't double-drain off the pack path.

    // TRIED (attempt 1, insufficient ALONE): adding only this RETURN drain did nothing, the held item
    // outline still floated. Root cause: under Iris the hand item is captured into the shared item-outline
    // queue DURING the level framegraph (Iris renders the hand in-pipeline), so LevelRendererMixin's
    // renderLevel-TAIL world drain already consumed AND cleared it (with the world projection, that's the
    // float) before this RETURN ran, leaving an empty queue here. The fix that made this drain effective:
    // route first-person items to a dedicated HELD_FP_OUTLINES queue the world drain never touches (see
    // EntityGlintRender.HELD_FP_OUTLINES + ItemRendererMixin's displayContext().firstPerson() gate), so the
    // hand item survives the world drain and only this hand-projection drain composites it.
    //
    // TRIED (attempt 2, STILL floated): with the dedicated queue in place, this drain ran with content but
    // re-applied the world `modelViewMatrix` (mvStack.mul(modelViewMatrix)). Wrong space. Verified against
    // Iris's HandRenderer.setupGlState/renderSolid (jars/iris_extract): under a pack Iris bakes the hand
    // perspective + bobHurt/bobView INTO the uploaded projection matrix and renders the hand with an
    // IDENTITY modelview, and the item submit poses are hand-LOCAL (relative to a fresh PoseStack). So
    // multiplying by the world view put the hand-local pose out into the world ≈1 block away, the float.
    //
    // FIX (attempt 3): we don't have Iris's baked projection (it's uploaded as an unreadable GpuBufferSlice),
    // but the plain hand perspective (`hudProjection`, set by vanilla at GameRenderer line 746) is STILL the
    // bound ProjMat at this RETURN, and the main depth was cleared right before the hand (line 747) so the
    // held item always reads visible. The only thing missing vs Iris's bake is bob, which we put into the
    // MODELVIEW instead: rebuild it with the same bobHurt/bobView vanilla/Iris use, set it as the modelview,
    // and drain. ProjMat(hud) × bob × hand-local-pose == what Iris drew. Matches the off-pack path too
    // (there vanilla puts bob in the pose and pushes modelViewMatrix, netting the same bob × pose).
