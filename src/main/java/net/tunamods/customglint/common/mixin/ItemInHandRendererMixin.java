/**
 * Drains the first-person held-item glow outlines.
 *
 * <p>First-person hand items run through the same deferred {@code ItemFeatureRenderer.renderItem} path
 * as world items, so {@code ItemRendererMixin} queues their outline jobs into the shared
 * {@code ITEM_OUTLINES} queue. But the main {@code RenderLevelStageEvent.AfterWeather} drain runs
 * during the level framegraph, which finishes <em>before</em> {@code GameRenderer.renderItemInHand},
 * so by the time the hand items queue, the level drain has already run and cleared its queue. Those jobs
 * would otherwise be dropped on the next frame's defensive reset, which is why the glow shows in 3rd
 * person / on dropped items but not on the held item in 1st person.
 *
 * <p>{@code renderHandsWithItems} submits the hand item nodes, then draws them
 * ({@code renderAllFeatures()}) and flushes ({@code endBatch()}) before returning, so at RETURN the hand
 * items are both queued and depth-committed to the main target. A second drain here composites their ring
 * (no entity bodies are queued in 1st person, so this only paints the hand items).
 * Vanilla clears the depth buffer before the hand render (GameRenderer), so the silhouette occlusion test
 * naturally reads "visible", correct, the held item always draws on top.
