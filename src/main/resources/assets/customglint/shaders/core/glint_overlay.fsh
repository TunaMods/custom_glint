// Custom Glints NORMAL-glint overlay fragment shader — the post-Iris counterpart of core/glint_color.fsh.
// The design brightness + per-vertex tint are identical to the in-phase glint; the only additions are the
// cutout alpha-test and the per-fragment scene-depth occlusion test, both needed because the model is
// re-rendered AFTER Iris finishes the frame (no in-phase surface depth to EQUAL-test against). Borrowed
// from core/chromatic_overlay.fsh / core/glow_silhouette.fsh.

uniform sampler2D Sampler1;     // model/atlas texture — its alpha drives the cutout silhouette

// Occlusion tolerance in BLOCKS of linear view distance (distance-independent, unlike a window-depth
// epsilon). This is the TIGHT variant, for OPAQUE entity-surface layers (sheep wool, saddle, clothing) and
// bodies whose depth is stably written to the committed buffer. The glint fills the whole SURFACE, so it must
// occlude the entity's OWN parts against each other (a sheep leg tucked under the wool, a limb behind the
// torso). Those inter-part gaps are small, so a coarse flat bias would leak the covered part through the
// front — the "body parts glint through the model" report. SLOPE-SCALED: the floor needed on a camera-FACING
// surface is tiny (our re-render matches the scene depth to ~mm); the bias only grows at grazing SILHOUETTE
// edges, where one pixel spans a large depth range and a too-tight bias would self-cull the surface's own rim.
// fwidth(viewDist) IS that per-pixel span. SLOPE_BIAS is kept LOW (0.6, matching the chromatic overlay): 1.5
// widened the grazing bias past the inter-part gaps and re-opened the show-through; 0.6 still clears the rim's
// own fwidth without ballooning far enough to leak a hidden limb. MIN_BIAS covers depth quantization + any
// Iris-vs-vanilla depth mismatch. TRANSLUCENT shells (slime) take the flat loose variant instead — see
// core/glint_overlay_loose.fsh (their re-sorted depth needs a coarse bias this tight test would drop out).
