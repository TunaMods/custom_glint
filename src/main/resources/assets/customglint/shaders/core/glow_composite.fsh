#version 150

// Custom Glints glow-outline composite (1.21.1) — PER-OBJECT id-aware, PER-CATEGORY thickness, single
// pass, constant thickness (no depth). The mask (glow_silhouette) packs a per-object KEY + visibility
// into alpha:
//   0        : empty (no silhouette here).
//   1..127   : in-shape but occluded (not used yet — the silhouette currently marks everything visible).
//   128..255 : VISIBLE, key = v - 128.
// The key is (category << 5) | id: top 2 bits = category, low 5 = id. rgb is that object's glow colour.
//
// A pixel rings iff a VISIBLE silhouette of a DIFFERENT id is within that source's CATEGORY thickness —
// the outer edge of every object plus the boundary wherever two objects overlap, each category its own
// width. Sampler0 (mask) MUST be NEAREST: alpha is a packed classifier, not a colour.

uniform sampler2D Sampler0;
// Kernel radius for THIS pass = the max thickness of the categories drained into the mask this pass.
// Set per drain by GlowOutlineRenderer (world items = 3, first-person held = 7). A source farther than a
// pixel's own ring width can never ring it, so the world drain searches only radius 3 (≈29 taps) instead
// of the FP drain's radius 7 (≈149 taps) — a ~5x cut with no change to the world ring. The per-source
// THICKNESS[] below still bounds each category's actual ring, so an over-large radius only wastes taps.
uniform int SearchRadius;
// Distance-thinning multiplier for THIS composite pass (1.0 = full thickness). Set per object/cluster by
// GlowOutlineRenderer from the object's camera distance, so a far (small-on-screen) object gets a
// proportionally thinner ring instead of a constant pixel ring that reads as fatter the farther it is.
uniform float ThicknessScale;

// Mask DEPTH (front-most silhouette depth per pixel — the mask RT writes depth with LEQUAL). Sampled here
// for RING OCCLUSION, NOT scene occlusion: it is the MASK's own depth attachment, a DIFFERENT target from
// the main colour buffer this pass writes, so there is no read/write-the-same-target feedback (that was
// the old crackle from sampling the MAIN depth here). ProjA/ProjB linearise it to eye distance (blocks)
// the same way the silhouette pass did — ProjMat[2][2] / ProjMat[3][2] of the world/hand projection.

// Restrict ring SOURCES to this outline id (key & 31), or -1 for any. The drain composites one pass per id
// far→near so a nearer object's whole outline layers over a farther one's; this filter is what makes each
// pass draw only its own object's ring.
uniform int TargetId;
// 0 = world: round (Euclidean) ring per CATEGORY thickness, with the morphological-opening anti-speckle
// guard. 1 = GUI: ring reach is exactly SearchRadius texels (set per-icon to a sub-icon-pixel thickness),
// SQUARE (Chebyshev) so corners stay crisp, and the opening guard is skipped (the GUI silhouette is clean,
// and the guard would erode a thin ring). Kept off the world path so 3D items are unaffected.
uniform int GuiMode;
// 1 = this composite pass's target object is the ONLY silhouette within its scissor box (no other id's
// texels can reach any pixel here — the drain sets it when the box overlaps no other object's box). That
// lets a pixel INSIDE the target's own silhouette skip the whole kernel: a ring needs a DIFFERENT id within
// reach and there is none, so an interior pixel can never ring. This is the deep-interior early-out — the
// dominant cost when a single filled silhouette (a close entity) covers much of the screen, since every one
// of its interior pixels would otherwise scan the full kernel only to discard. Pixel-identical output: the
// ring band (empty pixels) and any different-id pixel still scan. 0 = boxes overlap → full scan everywhere.
uniform int SoloTarget;
// Inward edge bleed in texels (0 = off). Under a shader pack the pack's final image renders the item a hair
// INSIDE our geometric silhouette (edge AA / alpha cutoff), leaving a hairline gap before the outward-only
// ring. When >0, the target silhouette's own border pixels (a target pixel within EdgeBleed texels of a
// non-silhouette pixel) are also painted, so the ring straddles the edge and the gap closes. Set only on the
// deferred under-pack world composite; 0 everywhere else (off-pack + GUI), so those paths are unchanged.
