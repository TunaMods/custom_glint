// Custom Glints NORMAL-glint overlay fragment shader, LOOSE-occlusion variant for TRANSLUCENT entity-layer
// shells (the slime outer cube). Identical to core/glint_overlay.fsh except for the occlusion bias.
//
// Why a separate variant: a translucent shell's depth in the committed scene buffer is unstable. Under a
// shader pack Iris re-sorts translucent geometry every frame, so the shell's own window depth flips with
// camera angle (and may not be written to the main depth at all; only the opaque geometry behind it is).
// The tight slope-scaled bias of the opaque variant (MIN_BIAS ~0.015) is far smaller than that per-frame
// wobble, so the shell self-occludes and the glint drops out on some faces at some angles. That is exactly
// the translucent-depth instability the 1.20.1 OPAQUE_DECAL fix was built around.
//
// The shell is a small convex NO_CULL hull: we do NOT want fine self-occlusion of it (a little back-face
// glint bleeding through a translucent blob is invisible). We only want CLEARLY nearer OPAQUE geometry (a
// mob or wall in front) to occlude it. So this variant uses a single flat, generous blocks-bias with no
// fwidth slope term: the pre-regression value that worked for slimes before the slope-scaled change.

// doesn't need a grazing-rim allowance because we tolerate its self-occlusion outright.
