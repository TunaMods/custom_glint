#version 330

// Custom Glints GUI item-outline fragment shader. Pairs with vanilla core/position_tex_color.vsh.
//
// Draws the inventory-icon glow as a MARGIN-item-pixel halo around the item silhouette, in the flat per-vertex
// Color (the glow colour fed by BlitRenderState). Uniform outward dilation: a fragment glows iff it is NOT on
// the icon but an item pixel lies within MARGIN item-pixels.
//
// Room to draw outside the icon: GuiRendererMixin blits this through a quad GROWN by MARGIN item-pixels on
// every side (scissor grown to match), UVs pinned to the item's atlas slot, so the icon appears at
// SCALE = (16 + 2*MARGIN)/16 inside the quad with a MARGIN-px border for the halo. Every sample maps back into
// the item's OWN slot (item-local coords clamped to [0,1]); off-item samples return empty, so the neighbouring
// icon is never read. Order-independent (discard-over-icon / draw-in-border), which works although the 26.1
// GUI sorts blits by pipeline, not submission order.
//
// The slot UV size s is computed EXACTLY from guiScale (the slot is always 16*guiScale atlas texels), NOT from
// fwidth or a packed pixel size. See the TRIED note: a drifting s was the real cause of the "cross-section"
// tearing, not the dilation itself.
//
// TRIED — do NOT repeat:
//   * Packing the quad's on-screen px size and recovering s via fwidth: the /4-encoded value OVERFLOWED 7 bits
//     on the zoomed wand preview and clamped to 127, so s was 15-37% wrong, floor(texCoord0/s) flipped mid-
//     icon, and the outline tore into CROSS LINES / diagonal shear. Fixed by deriving s from guiScale exactly.
//   * Scale-from-centre silhouette (enlarge the icon from its centre, mask with the real icon): on a thin
//     DIAGONAL item (sword) the radial scale runs ALONG the blade, so the long sides never stick out — the
//     "outline" collapsed to streaks at the ends. Radial scaling can't outline thin off-radial shapes.
//   * Inner-RIM (paint the icon's own outermost pixels): drew ON the texture, not around it. Looked awful.
//   * Round-disc neighbourhood for the dilation: DASHED 45-degree edges (the (1,1) diagonal drops out below
//     ~1.41 radius). Use the SQUARE (Chebyshev) neighbourhood below.
