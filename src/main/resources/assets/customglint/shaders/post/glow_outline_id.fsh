// Custom Glints glow-outline composite: PER-OBJECT id-aware, PER-CATEGORY thickness, single pass. The
// mask (core/glow_silhouette) packs a per-object KEY + visibility into alpha:
//   0        : empty (no silhouette here).
//   1..127   : IN-SHAPE but OCCLUDED, key = v.
//   128..255 : VISIBLE, key = v - 128.
// The key is (category << 5) | id: the top 2 bits are the object's category, the low 5 are its id. rgb is
// that object's glow colour.
//
// A pixel rings iff a VISIBLE silhouette of a DIFFERENT object (different id) is within that source's
// CATEGORY thickness. That rings the outer edge of every object PLUS the boundary wherever two objects overlap,
// and each category can have its own ring width. MaskSampler MUST be NEAREST (alpha is a packed classifier).
//
// Cost note: an in-shape interior pixel with no other object within reach scans the whole kernel before
// discarding (no cheap "deep interior" early-out). Fine for normal scenes; heavier under extreme entity
// crams. Mitigate with outlineRenderScale (downscale) or smaller THICKNESS values.

// SEARCH MUST be >= ceil(max of these). If you set any above 7, raise SEARCH to match AND raise
// EntityGlintRender.SCISSOR_PAD to >= that + ~4 so the thicker ring isn't clipped at the group rect edge.

// Distance-proportional thinning. A constant pixel-width ring looks FATTER the farther (smaller on screen)
// an object gets. To stop that, each source's reach scales by REF_DIST / itsDistance, clamped to [MIN_SCALE,1]:
// closer than REF_DIST keeps the full THICKNESS, farther narrows ∝ 1/distance so the ring tracks the object's
// apparent size. MIN_SCALE floors it so far rings don't vanish.
//
// The source distance comes from the MASK target's own depth, NOT the scene depth. A source texel sits on
// the silhouette RIM, and the scene depth there belongs to whatever the rasterizer resolved for that pixel,
// which along a rim is often the BACKGROUND behind the object rather than the object. (The mask's visibility
// test can't catch it: reading a far background depth still satisfies viewDist <= sceneDist.) So rim texels
// read a distance that flips between the object and the sky from texel to texel and frame to frame. Both
// things that consume srcDist then flip with it: the reach scale snaps between full and MIN_SCALE, and the
// ring-occlusion test below disqualifies whole rim segments. That is the outline WARPING and breaking up at
// range, when the silhouette is almost entirely rim. The mask target has its own depth attachment, cleared
// to far and written by GLOW_MASK_PIPE at exactly the texels it shades, so sampling it gives the object's
// true distance with no background bleed. Do not switch this back to DepthSampler.

// Ring occlusion bias, in BLOCKS. A source's ring skips any pixel whose scene geometry is at least this
// much nearer than the source edge the ring comes from. Applied to ALL categories: it keeps a farther
// object's ring from painting over a nearer object standing in front of it (two players side by side no
// longer bleed their outlines onto each other), and keeps a held/dropped item's halo off the hand gripping
// it. The ring expands outward from a visible edge regardless of what is in front of those outer pixels, so
// without this test the halo draws over whatever is nearer. Measured in blocks so it is distance-independent
// (same basis as core/glow_silhouette's OCCLUSION_BIAS).

// texel. Tested as a hard in/out (d2 > r*r), that union traces the silhouette's own stair-steps and scallops
// into a sawtooth wherever the edge runs diagonally. At range the distance thinning drops r to ~1.6 texels,
// so the scallop is as big as the band and the whole ring reads jagged. Fading the last texel of the reach
// makes the union a coverage field instead, and the pipeline blends TRANSLUCENT, so fractional alpha
// antialiases the outer boundary and the scallop with it. Larger blurs the ring, smaller brings the steps back.
